# ECU Circuit Model

Description: Research and design a simple automotive system, modeling the behavior and environment of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). System design includes a sensor suite, circuit block diagramming, ECU logic, and expected output values and possible Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Specific sensor research and selection includes any relevent conversion factors, and circuit diagramming includes the use of appropriate power ground circuits and ECU blocking. ECU logic design includes pseudo-coding the conversion of signal values to meaningful values,  determining nominal ranges and failure conditions, and describing the failure behaviors.
